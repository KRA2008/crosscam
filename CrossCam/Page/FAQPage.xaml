After you turn on mirror mode, CrossCam will tell you which side to hold your mirror on. Hold your mirror on that side and fuss with the alignment between your phone and the mirror and your subject. With some patience, you'll be able to line them all up so that the mirror shows the correct perspective for one of the sides.
