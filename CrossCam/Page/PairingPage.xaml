This is simply an Android requirement and is completely outside my control. CrossCam does not actually USE your location in any way, but because the act of searching for (and finding) nearby devices could theoretically be used to roughly locate you, CrossCam requires permission to access your location. Note that CrossCam still does not use an internet connection or even request internet permission, so it can't transmit location data anywhere even if it did collect it.">
