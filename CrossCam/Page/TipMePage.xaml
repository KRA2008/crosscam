I love working on CrossCam but it takes a lot of time and effort. I make no money from CrossCam at all except tips people might decide to send me. As of March 2023 I have not received a tip from anybody and I haven't asked for tips in CrossCam before. If you like CrossCam, please consider sending me a tip."
