The key is to crop the right edge of the left picture slightly past what the right edge of the right picture shows of the scene and vice-versa. Adding a border is toggled on the Settings page. If this is confusing, just crop a bunch off the inside edges and it will start to be clear. The crop button for the inside edges looks like this:"/>

You can always load, auto align, and edit the pictures later. That way your companions don't have to wait for you to perfect your pictures on the spot, but you can still be confident that the depth you want is really there. Just be careful not to do any hasty editing before the first save! You can also turn on the separate side saving which will ignore any editing you do."/>

By turning left and right the depth on the donut will change relative to the rest of the scene - set the donut's depth so it is either on or behind the most distant point in your scene.
