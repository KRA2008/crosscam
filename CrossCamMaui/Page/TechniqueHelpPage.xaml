Slowly move the tube toward the screen while trying to look down the tube with both eyes. When you reach the right position with the tube the image should snap into place. It may help to concentrate on trying to look at the inside of the far end of the tube. If you can't find the right position, try using a larger image or a smaller tube.&#10; &#x2022; For parallel view: hold a tube in front of each eye, but point them both out sideways, so you can hardly see anything. Slowly turn the tubes inward at the same time so you can start seeing more of the image. The moment you can see most of the image (almost half with each eye), try to relax your eyes and bring the halves together. It may help to use a larger or smaller image."/>

For example, on one side draw one eye and a mouth, and on the other side draw an eye and a nose. You can then hold them up in front of you and practice fusing the two images together to complete the smiley face."/>
