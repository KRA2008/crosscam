Please note: CrossCam requires location permission and for location services to be turned on on the primary device in order to connect to the secondary device. This is simply an Android requirement and is completely outside my control. CrossCam does not actually USE your location in any way, but because the act of searching for nearby devices could theoretically be used to roughly locate you, CrossCam requires permission to access your location. Note that CrossCam still does not use an internet connection or even request internet permission, so it can't transmit location data anywhere even if it did collect it."/>

            <Label Text=" &#x2022; CrossCam is software, not hardware, so capturing the photos may be slightly out of sync depending on what else the processors and memory are doing at the precise moment the capture is triggered. As a result, the synchronization may sometimes not be perfect, but it should generally be very close."/>
