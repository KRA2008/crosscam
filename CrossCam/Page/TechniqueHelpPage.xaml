            <Label Text="There are a lot of different ways to see 3D. Sometimes you use a headset, sometimes you wear some special glasses, but CrossCam specializes in 3D that just takes a regular screen and a little bit of practice. All these different methods use the same root principle though - make each eye see a slightly different image (just like in real life) and let your amazing brain do the rest. It's very important that you put in the practice needed though, or CrossCam will be pretty pointless for you."/>
            <Label Text=" "/>
            <Label Text="As you read this text, your eyes are both pointing at the same place on the screen. However, if you carefully make them point at different places, you can make each eye see something different. If what each eye sees is a photograph of a scene taken from a slightly different perspective, your brain won't know the difference, and you will feel like you are seeing the scene in real life 3D."/>
            <Label Text=" "/>
            <Label Text="There are two ways to make your eyes point at different places: cross and parallel. Lots of people can easily cross their eyes, but have never had to do it in a controlled way in order to see something before. Everyone's eyes can go parallel (or &quot;wall eyed&quot;) - it's what your eyes do when you completely relax them and kind of stare into the distance or day dream or fall asleep, but not everyone can make them go parallel on command. If you're able to manually cross your eyes, you should definitely try the cross method first, otherwise you probably want to try parallel first."/>
            <Label Text=" "/>
            <Label Text="Both methods will let you see CrossCam's 3D, but different people find one method easier than the other, while lots of people can easily do both. It's also very important to know which method you're using, otherwise the sides will be mixed up and the 3D won't work right. It's vital that the correct eye points at the correct side - and those sides are switched between cross and parallel, which is why a pair of pictures will only ever work for cross or parallel viewing, but not both at once (unless you swap the sides)."/>
